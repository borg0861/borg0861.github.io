subtitle: Who is behind Science Fantasy for Draw Steel?
---

My name is Brent, and I'm a huge nerd. I live near Kansas City with my wife and two kids.

As much as I enjoy fantasy, regardless of the flavor, science fiction has always been the genre I connect with most. As a result, I'm always looking for great RPGs which can delivery on the fantasies I love most.

There are some great games out there. [The Expanse RPG](https://greenroninstore.com/collections/the-expanse-rpg) is a stand-out in this area for me. It offers fantastic action and cool stunts. Unfortunately, the level scaling really breaks down after about level 8.

There are also superb community maintained resources for settings that I want to emulate. [Mass Effect 5e](https://www.n7.world/) is a key example of this. I love how detailed and fully featured this mod for D&D5e is! Unfortunately, I just don't think that D&D5e really delivers on the fantasy of Mass Effect.

All of this is why I was so excited when I first played *DRAW STEEL*. It felt heroic. It felt cinematic. It was tactical. And it could deliver on the fantasy of Mass Effect and other media like that really, really well.

But that takes work. Which is why this exists!
