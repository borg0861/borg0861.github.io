<p>Science Fantasy for Draw Steel is a fan supplment for <i>DRAW STEEL</i> which is meant to help evoke the feeling of some excellent Science Fantasy video games, like Mass Effect, Destiny, Control, Anthem, and more.</p>

<p>While these games aren't fantasy in the same way that many people define that genre, they are fantastical, and they fit neatly into the same definitions used by <i>DRAW STEEL</i>. These "Science Fantasy" settings focus more on gunplay and technology than on magic and mysticism than the default setting for <i>DRAW STEEL</i>. As a result, this has been created as a supplemental work which tailors specific elements of the core systems of <i>DRAW STEEL</i> to a more explicity Science Fantasy theme, and which adds some classes and rules that let players experience some of the more detailed fantasies offered in Science Fantasy.</p>

<h2>Our Development Philosophy</h2>
<p>We don't want to develop this supplement in a box. In fact, it is entirely intended that we serve a wide range of different branches of Science Fantasy, not just the ones that any one person is enamored with.</p>

<p>That could mean that there are classes and rules specific to a mecha game! The initial development has been focused around the fantasy of Mass Effect. That doesn't mean that those are the limits. In fact, they shouldn't be.</p>

<h3>Community Input is Welcome</h3>
<p>We want to get as many people involved in this effort as possible. We firmly believe that having more input from the community will result in a better toolbox of rules we can try.</p>

<h2>Legal Stuff</h2>
<p>Really, this entire section boils down to: <b>No Infringement Intended</b></p>

<p>While I am absolutely trying to capture the feeling and fantasy of characters and some aspects of gameplay for some of my favorite media, I have no intention of infringing on anyone’s legal rights. If you are concerned that content in this document is potentially straying too close to what inspired it, please bring it up! I’ll make any necessary changes to ensure each element is distinct enough that there aren’t any issues.</p>
