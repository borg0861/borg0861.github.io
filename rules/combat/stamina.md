title: Stamina
---

Your hero’s survivability is represented by your Stamina. Think of Stamina as a combination of a creature’s physical vitality, their overall energy for dodging and resisting incoming blows and other violence. <span class="changed-text">Stamina also includes any active defenses like shields or gravitic barriers.</span> It’s not that every instance of damage deals a bleeding wound to you, but that each one chips away at your ability to fight effectively. An attack might make you sweat as you <span class="changed-text">hunker behind cover to avoid a barrage of bullets, while another might be stopped by your shields, leaving you depleted and open to another attack.</span> Eventually, though, this draining of energy leaves you open for bigger blows that can truly harm your body—or possibly kill you.

After any damage you take is reduced by damage immunity or other effects, your Stamina is reduced by an amount equal to the remaining damage. Some effects can also reduce your Stamina maximum, limiting the amount of Stamina you can regain.

<div class="box-note" markdown="1">#### Why Not Have Separate Shields and Barriers?
Stamina is balanced really well already by Draw Steel’s core mechanisms, and it represents everything we want it to represent. There are also already enough pools and different effects to track, and we don’t think that adding more would enhance the fantasy. 

If you really want to think of shields or barriers as separate from your health in some mechanical way, you can use the following guidelines:

- **Shield or Barrier Depletion:** Shields and barriers are absorbing any damage you would take when your Stamina would be reduced but still remain above 0. 
- **Taking Health Damage:** You actually start taking physical damage when your Stamina would be reduced to below 0. In science fantasy, actually getting hit with a bullet, blaster bolt, or other high-tech weapon really hurts and will almost certainly start you down the road to death.
