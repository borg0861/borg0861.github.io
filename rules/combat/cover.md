The ubiquity of firearms in science fantasy means the importance of cover cannot be overstated. As a result we have modified some of the rules regarding Cover to represent the important role that cover plays in science fantasy combat.

When you have line of effect to a creature or object but that target has at least half their form blocked by a solid obstruction such as a tree, wall, barricade, or overturned table, the target has cover.

## Types of Cover <span class="pill pill-new">NEW</span>
The proportion of the target’s form determines which type of cover they have, and any effects of that cover  There are three levels of cover: light, medium, and full.

### Light Cover <span class="pill pill-new">NEW</span>
When half of a target’s form is behind cover, that creature has Light Cover. You take a bane on abilities that deal damage against creatures or objects behind Light Cover. 

Being prone counts as Light Cover when you are targeted with a Ranged strike or ability.

### Medium Cover <span class="pill pill-new">NEW</span>
When at least three quarters of a target’s form is behind cover, that creature has Medium Cover. You take a double bane on abilities that deal damage against creatures or objects behind Medium Cover.

### Full Cover <span class="pill pill-new">NEW</span>
When all of a target’s form is behind cover, that creature has Full Cover. You cannot normally target creatures or objects behind Full Cover.

**Note:** Full cover is included here because there are certain situations in which it is important to distinguish that a character cannot be targeted because they are in full cover and not for another reason.

## Destroying Cover <span class="pill pill-new">NEW</span>
You can choose to target cover instead of a creature who is behind it. Additionally, cover hit by area abilities can be destroyed without impacting the damage dealt to other targets.
