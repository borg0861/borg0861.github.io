We have added some rules about fighting in Zero-G as well as some rules about fighting in vacuum.

## Zero-G Basics
Moving and Combat in zero-G varies widely depending on what kind of science fantasy you want to evoke.

In many settings heroes can rely on jump-jets, maneuvering thrusters, or something similar to allow them to navigate and compensate for the inertial effects of firing weapons, etc. If your characters are in a setting like that, you don’t need to change the basics all that much. Instead, treat all characters as if they had the Fly and Hover movement keywords, and all forced movement as if it added the Vertical keyword to it. Easy.

### Advanced Zero-G Movement
If  you want a more nuanced look at zero-g, or if your heroes are without their maneuvering jets, then a character must be able to push off of an object or creature. This isn’t as simple as a regular move action. Use the following free triggered action  instead.

###### Push Off
> You use an object’s mass to propel yourself.

| **Keywords:** Movement, Zero-G | **Type:** Free Triggered Action |
| **Distance:** Melee 1 | **Target:** One creature or object |

**Trigger:** You would use movement while under the effects of zero-G.  
**Effect:** You may choose to move a number of squares in a straight line up to your remaining movement. This number of squares is applied as a Vertical Push to the target of this action in a direction opposite the direction you move. You must subtract your Stability from your movement, and you must also subtract the target’s Stability from their forced movement, as normal.

**Example:** John wants to move across the room to position himself to attack. He uses Push Off on a wall, and uses 5 squares of movement. He has Stability 1, so he can move 4 squares. The wall has Stability ∞ so it does not move at all.

**Example 2:** Jane would normally be able to slide 2 away from an enemy as the result of one of her abilities. She uses Push Off. Her stability is 0, so she moves 2 squares. Her enemy has Stability 1 so he moves 1 square in the opposite direction. They are now 3 squares apart.

### Advanced Combat in Zero-G
Melee and Ranged attacks must also account for the special dynamics of Zero-G. In an effort to simplify and abstract this, use these guidelines:

- **Ability Modifier:** Add the following to the effect of any ability that includes physical interaction with its target and doesn’t already include a Forced Movement effect: ***“You move 1 square away from the target or targets. The target or targets of this ability are subjected to Vertical Push 1 in a direction opposite the direction in which you moved. You must subtract your Stability from the distance you move.”***
- **Forced Movement Modifier:** Abilities that inflict Forced Movement and include physical interaction with its target gain the following additional effect: ***“All Forced Movement effects of this ability are converted to Vertical Push or Vertical Pull, respectively. You move in a straight line a number of squares equal to the Forced Movement you inflict on the target or targets of this ability, but in a direction opposite the Forced Movement. Subtract your Stability from the distance you move.”***

{: .box-warning}
**Important Note:** Most firearms in most settings will use these rules due to the necessary force of launching a projectile. In limited circumstances (blasters or other energy weapons) the force of the energy directed to the target is not primarily physical and could ignore these rules.


## What About Low-G or High-G?
That can get complicated fast. To simplify it use the following guidelines:
- **Low-G:** Jump Distances are Doubled. Add 2 to Forced Movement distances.
- **High-G:** Jump Distances are Halved. Add 2 to Stability for all Creatures and Objects.

## Vacuum
Vacuum has a large set of horrifying physical effects which are very different from those experienced when drowning or suffering simply from oxygen deprivation.

For the purposes of this game, however, if a character would be exposed to the effects of vacuum, simply follow the core rules for Suffocating.
