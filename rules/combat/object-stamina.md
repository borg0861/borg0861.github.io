title: Object Stamina
---

Mundane objects in the game have Stamina based on the material they’re made of. When an object’s Stamina is reduced to 0 <span class="changed-text">in a single turn</span> the object is destroyed. Objects have Damage Immunity: All to poison and psychic damage. Objects made of common materials have stamina as follows:
- A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made of glass has 1 Stamina.
- A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made of wood has 3 Stamina.
- A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made of stone has 6 Stamina.
- A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made of metal has 9 Stamina.

The Director can decide that a well-made or poorly made object has more or less Stamina. <span class="changed-text">Additionally, the Director may allow damage to accrue across multiple turns, rather than requiring damage to be dealt in a single turn.</span>
Destroying a supernatural object often (but not always) requires a specific quest, such as throwing a magic ring back into the volcano where it was forged.
