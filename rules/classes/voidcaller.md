You are a Voidcaller, a master of gravitic energy manipulation. The hum of latent power resonates within you as you channel your abilities, lifting enemies into the air or flinging them aside with a gesture.

Your choice of Voidcaller Discipline & Mnemonics  determines many of the features you’ll gain from this class.

## Intensity {#intensity}
The power you serve grants you a heroic resource called Intensity, fueling your abilities as you exercise control over the raw forces of the universe.

### Intensity In Combat
At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain Intensity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 Intensity.

Additionally, you can gain more Intensity by attempting to focus your inborn gravitic abilities. When you roll to gain 1d3 Intensity  at the start of your turn, you can focus to gain the following additional effects (no action required):  
- If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional Intensity but have strained yourself by trying to reach beyond your normal limits. You take psychic damage equal to 1d6 + your level, which can’t be reduced in any way.
- If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 additional Intensity.
- If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 additional Intensity and can activate a Mnemonic Effect of your choice (see below).  
You lose any remaining Intensity at the end of the encounter.

### Intensity Outside of Combat
Though you can’t gain Intensity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost Intensity without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs Intensity, you can’t use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited Intensity on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of Intensity on it equal to your Victories.

## Mnemonics {#mnemonics}
Your choice of Mnemonics  provides you with extra ways that you can earn Intensity during combat. These ways of gaining Intensity are triggered by events that happen during combat. There is a chance that you could have a single event trigger both of your Mnemonic effects.

Additionally, whenever you activate a by focusing to gain Intensity, choose one of your Mnemonic Effects. That effect occurs immediately.

#### Break Their Defenses {#break-their-defenses}

- **Intensity:** You gain 2 Intensity the first time in an encounter that you or a creature within 10 squares of you deals damage in an amount greater than or equal to 10 + your level.  
- **Mnemonic Effect:** One enemy of your choice within 10 squares of you takes damage equal to three times your Intuition score.

#### Disrupt Their Plans {#disrupt-their-plans}

- **Mnemonic Effect:** You crush two enemies of your choice within 10 squares of you with gravitic energy. Each target takes corruption damage equal to twice your Intuition score.

#### Feast on Their Misery {#feast-on-their-misery}

- **Mnemonic Effect:** Three allies of your choice within 10 squares of you, including yourself, gain two surges.

#### Spread the Pain {#spread-the-pain}
- **Intensity:** You gain 2 Intensity the first time in an encounter that a creature within 10 squares of you uses an ability with the Area keyword.  
- **Mnemonic Effect:** Each enemy in a 3-cube area within 10 squares of you takes corruption damage equal to twice your Intuition score.

#### Twist the Odds {#twist-the-odds}
- **Intensity:** You gain 2 Intensity the first time in an encounter that an ally within 10 squares of you gets a tier 3 result or an enemy within 10 squares of you gets a tier 1 result.
