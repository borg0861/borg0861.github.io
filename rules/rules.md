Science Fantasy for Draw Steel is a fan supplment for *DRAW STEEL* which is meant to help evoke the feeling of some excellent Science Fantasy video games, like Mass Effect, Destiny, Control, Anthem, and more.

While these games aren't fantasy in the same way that many people define that genre, they are fantastical, and they fit neatly into the same definitions used by *DRAW STEEL*. These "Science Fantasy" settings focus more on gunplay and technology than on magic and mysticism than the default setting for *DRAW STEEL*. As a result, this has been created as a supplemental work which tailors specific elements of the core systems of *DRAW STEEL* to a more explicity Science Fantasy theme, and which adds some classes and rules that let players experience some of the more detailed fantasies offered in Science Fantasy.

## Overall Changes
We've made a few overall changes which apply broadly. Keep these basic changes in mind as you read and review any of the other rules in Science Fantasy for Draw Steel.

### Magic → Tech
Clarke’s third law states that “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” None of our classes use the term magic. Instead, we’ve replaced that term with Tech. It represents the same idea, but fits our desired theme a bit better. If you want to translate our classes to work with the defaults in Draw Steel (or vice versa) just do a find-and-replace.

### Psionic → Gravitic
“What’s the difference between psionics and gravitics?” you ask.
There isn’t one. We just wanted to make up our own quasi-scientific term for abilities that allow people to do crazy stuff like telepathy and telekinesis. If you want to translate our classes to work with the defaults in Draw Steel (or vice versa) just do a find-and-replace.

### Classes Without Kits
In Science Fantasy for Draw Steel we assume that all characters are capable of using Light Ranged Weapons (such as pistols and submachine guns), and wearing armor. These classes still do not gain access to any of the bonuses or Signature Actions granted by kits unless they obtain access to a kit.

Any abilities, enhancements, or features that grant access to light weapons and light armor, for equipment or treasures, instead allows characters to use medium weapons or armor.
