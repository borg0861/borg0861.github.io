title: Conditions
---

With the fantasy we are attempting to invoke, there are a few additional conditions we added to make things easier to manage.

### Lifted <span class="pill pill-new">NEW</span>
> You hover over the ground, unable to move.

While you are Lifted, your speed is 0 and you cannot benefit from abilities or effects which allow you to move or shift, and you are treated as if your stability is 0. Your ability power rolls take a bane, abilities against you gain an edge, and you have a bane on Might and Agility tests.

If you leave the space in which you were Lifted, whether by teleporting or as a result of forced movement, the condition ends as soon as that movement is resolved.

### Primed <span class="pill pill-new">NEW</span>
While you are Primed, any ability with a Detonator keyword will deal additional damage equal to the highest characteristic of the creature using the Detonator ability to all creatures and objects in Burst 1. This damage is of the same type as the triggering ability. You are no longer Primed after taking this damage.

### Prone <span class="pill pill-new">NEW</span>
While you are prone, you are flat on the ground, <span class="changed-text">melee</span> strikes you make take a bane, and melee abilities made against you gain an edge. You must crawl to move along the ground, which costs you 1 additional square of movement for every square you crawl. You canâ€™t climb, jump, swim, or fly while prone. If you are climbing, flying, or jumping while you are knocked prone, you fall.

While prone, you can stand up as a maneuver (see Maneuvers in Combat), unless the ability or effect that imposed the condition says otherwise. You can use a maneuver to make an adjacent prone creature stand up.

### Suppressed <span class="pill pill-new">NEW</span>
While you are Suppressed, you have a Bane on all abilities or attacks with a Power Roll. Additionally, if you move, the creature or effect which inflicted this condition upon you can make a single Opportunity Attack against you using either their ranged or melee free strike. The condition ends once you suffer the effects of an Opportunity Attack as a result of this condition. If you gain the Suppressed condition from one creature while already suppressed by a different creature, the new condition replaces the old one.

**Reminder:** You cannot make an Opportunity Attack if you have a Bane on the attack roll. That means that if a Suppressed creature is in cover, they cannot suffer the Opportunity Attack of the Suppressed condition.
